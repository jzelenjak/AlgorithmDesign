 * A candy store wants to review their collection of k sweets for the upcoming Halloween Holiday. A set of n frequent users was selected to participate in a sweets testing event. Every participant has a demand of di sweets intake to participate in the review. However, to avoid any major sugar spikes, each is allowed only a maximum amount of ai sweets. (1 <= i <= n) Moreover, each person has a list of candy he doesnâ€™t like, that he/she will not review (such as liquorice). For the testing event, a quantity qi of each candy is provided. Moreover, for a candy to have a valid review, a minimum of ci persons need to approve it. (1 <= j <= k)
 *
 * The owner of the store tasks you to find if the chosen frequent users are enough to review all his candy.
