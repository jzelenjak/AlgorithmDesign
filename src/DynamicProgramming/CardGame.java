/**
 * The game is a simple card game that features a deck of n â‰¥ 2 cards. The game has both a single-player
 * and two-player variant. In the single-player version your goal is to select a subset of cards from the deck
 * so that the sum of their values is maximised, but you are not allowed to pick two cards that immediately
 * follow each other in the deck.
 * In the two-player variant, players take turns. In your turn you can chose to either take the top card of
 * the deck, or the bottom card. Your goal is to maximise your score assuming your opponent does all in
 * their power to minimise your score.
 * For example, if we have a deck of 4 cards: 3, 5, 18, 7 then in the single player variant we can get to
 * a score of at most 18+3 = 21. In the two-player variant, the starting player takes 3 (because if they
 * take 7, the opponent would take 18 and win the game!), then the other player is forced to take either
 * 5 or 7, meaning the starting player can take 18 and win the game. See the tests in WebLab for more
 * examples. The tests added by the spec tests only test both methods in one, so use the visible tests to
 * debug individual methods.
