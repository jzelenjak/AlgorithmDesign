 * The problem of understanding the two-dimensional structure of an RNA-molecule (RNA Secondary Structure) is defined as follows:

 *  find a set S of base pairs (i, j) that is as large as possible and meets some criteria.
 *  If a base pair (i, j) meets these criteria, we write p(i, j). (This function is given in the form of a compatibility matrix.)
